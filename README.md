### Midnight Reverser (aka Mateus Gualberto)

Hi, I'm a Brazillian IT Security professional and hobbyst programmer.  
I love to program in C, C++, Rust and other system-level and kernel-level languages. I'm a low level hacker!  
I like to study computer architectures, exploit binary-level vulnerabilities and take a deep dive in several security and programming subjects.
